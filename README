README

LibICMP is a small and simple API for sending and receiving ICMP packets
from your application.  Currently only IPv4 is supported, so any patches
for adding support for IPv6 are most welcome!

For some useful examples, see the included iping.c and example.c, the
former makes use of more features and the latter is more bare bones.

LibICMP was initally developed by Tim Lawless and later refactored and
extended upon by Joachim Wiberg.
